# chr-ext

This simple extension allows you to easily remove videos from the 'Watch Later' playlist on YouTube. It adds a button to each playlist item for quick one-click removal. This is convenient for those who watch a lot of videos and want to easily manage their watchlist.

Page reload may be required if buttons did not appear on the Watch-later playlist page first visit.
